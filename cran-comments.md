## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Exported add_series_no() and add_text_id() in: add_series_no.Rd.
* Removed \dontrun{} in example of add_series_no().
* Removed the codes of moranajp() that write in user's filespace.
* Removed encoding setting from vignettes because of needless.
* Revised readme.md, vignettes, and text to match the above.

## Test environments
